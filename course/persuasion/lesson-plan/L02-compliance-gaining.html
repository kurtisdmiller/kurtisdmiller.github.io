        <li>Review: Compliance-gaining is distinct from persuasion because it is focused on changing behavior only
            <ul>
                <li>No interest in any change in attitudes, beliefs, or values</li>
                <li>Compliance-gaining can often be ethical</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Marwell &amp; Schmidt&rsquo;s Typology of Compliance-Gaining Strategies. Marwell &amp; Schmitt did a large study in 1967 and identified 16 common ways that people try to get other people to do what they want.
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Threat (a "negative promise") <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>I will never make you cookies again if you don&rsquo;t vote. &nbsp;(I will also taunt you with every bad decision the elected leader makes if the wrong person wins.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Liking

        <li>Choosing influence strategies <br />
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Review: People tend to prefer using friendly strategies in general.</li>
                <li>Review: Primary dimensions: Our decisions about how to pursue an influence goal can be thought of as belonging to one of two primary dimensions:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: What will work the best?</li>
                        <li><strong>Appropriateness</strong>: What is socially acceptable?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Review: Secondary dimensions (other considerations we take into account) include:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Identity goals</strong>: our moral standards for who we want to be</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction goals</strong>: creating and maintaining a good impression</li>
                        <li><strong>Resource goals</strong>: maintaining important relationships and increasing personal rewards</li>
                        <li><strong>Arousal goals</strong>: wanting not to get too nervous, overwhelmed, or stressed out&ndash; either by going through with the influence attempt or by not doing anything about getting what we want</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Review: Our choices also depend on our knowledge of the other person
                    <ol>
                        <li>We are more likely to use threats or other harsh strategies with strangers we don&rsquo;t have to see again.</li>
                        <li>We use a wider variety of strategies with strangers than intimates (trial and error).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Compliance-gaining strategy choice depends on assessments of:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Importance of getting compliance.</strong> We are more willing to accept harsher strategies when we believe that getting compliance is very important.</li>
                        <li><strong>How successful we think the strategy will be.</strong> We adapt our strategy to the person who is our target and we use what we think will work best with them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Power and control.</strong> Our dominance in the relationship. If we have more reward, coercive, and legitimate power, we have a wider range of strategies at our disposal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Intimacy.</strong> The degree of emotional attachment. Impersonal/short-term relationships vs. Interpersonal/long-term relationships</li>
                        <li><strong>Relational consequences.</strong> (Long vs. short term) We&rsquo;re unlikely to want to create long-term damage to a relationship we want to preserve</li>
                        <li><strong>Resistance.</strong> Whether we think the other person will defy us</li>
                        <li><strong>Rights</strong>. The belief that our request is justified (Note: corresponds to legitimate power)</li>
                        <li><strong>Personal benefits.</strong> An assessment of what we think will benefit either/both of us the most. (Why would we engage in compliance gaining if it benefits someone other than ourselves?)</li>
                        <li><strong>Apprehension</strong>. Nerves may keep us from acting the way we would like to</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
