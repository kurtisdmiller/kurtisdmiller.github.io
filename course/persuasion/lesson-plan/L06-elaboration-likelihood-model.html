				Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)
</h1>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This lesson orients students to the elaboration likelihood model and its use in persuasion research</p>
<p>By the end of this lesson, the student will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contrast the central and the peripheral information processing routes</li>
    <li>Identify the process and factors that influence the use of central vs. peripheral route processing</li>
    <li>Contrast the most effective message features in the central and the peripheral route</li>
    <li>Identify situations central vs. peripheral route persuasive appeals are more effective<span style="color: #e03e2d;"><br /></span></li>

                <li>People don&rsquo;t necessarily pay attention to (or think about) good messages.</li>
                <li>How do we know if our audience is going to process our message?</li>
                <li>What determines whether they think about the arguments in a message just a little bit or a whole lot?</li>
                <li>How do we know when we should use flashy &ldquo;image&rdquo;-based appeals and when we should use serious evidence for what we&rsquo;re arguing?</li>

    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
        <li>The elements of the Elaboration Likelihood Model.
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Developed by Petty and Cacioppo in 1986.</li>
                <li>The model that suggests we process persuasive messages in two different ways:
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Central route</li>
                        <li>Peripheral route</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>We may use both simultaneously, but we tend to favor one route over another depending on a number of factors.
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Elaboration: Issue-relevant thinking, Cognitive attention.</li>
                        <li>Likelihood: The probability that you will spend time thinking about the object of the persuasive attempt.</li>
                        <li>Central Route of persuasion: Involves high elaboration (in other words, lots of issue-relevant thinking.)</li>
                        <li>Peripheral route of persuasion: Involves low elaboration (in other words, little rational thought is used.)</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The two cognitive routes we use to process messages.
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>The Central Route to Persuasion (careful thought)<br />
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>When elaboration is high, we pay a great deal of attention to message arguments and we think about lots of things that might be relevant to the message.</li>
                        <li>Central route is used when:
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>The receiver&rsquo;s degree of involvement is high.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Involvement: Relevance to the receiver. &nbsp;Perception that issue has a high impact on receiver. High level of commitment/investment.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>There are multiple sources giving multiple messages.</li>
                                <li>The receiver has a high cognitive capacity.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Even if we can get people to elaborate, there is no guarantee that they will LIKE the message. To maximize positive feelings toward your message:
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Include proattitudinal arguments (things the audience already agrees with).</li>
                                <li>Use language that your audience understands (translate technical terms into appropriate language for your target). If they don&rsquo;t understand you, they&rsquo;ll use the peripheral route.</li>
                                <li>Use multiple strong arguments with good evidence (quality + quantity).</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The Peripheral Route to Persuasion (quick thought)<br />
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>When elaboration is low, receivers use cognitive shortcuts called heuristics (also called &ldquo;heuristic cues&rdquo;) to decide whether or not to comply.</li>
                        <li>Peripheral route is used when:
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>The receiver&rsquo;s degree of involvement is low.</li>
                                <li>There is a single source for information. (This creates a greater reliance on heuristic cues.)</li>
                                <li>The receiver has lower cognitive capacity.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Highly distracted, cognitively overloaded, lower in need for cognition.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Types of heuristics used to process messages when using the peripheral route:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Source is high in credibility</li>
                                        <li>Attractive, likable source</li>
                                        <li>Consensus among other receivers of the message</li>
                                        <li>Number of arguments (or length of message) rather than content</li>
                                        <li>Use of emotion to persuade</li>
                                        <li>The information used in peripheral processing is inherently easier for our brains to process (than facts, evidence, reasoning).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Selecting information processing methods.<br />
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Our choice of route depends on the situation:
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Motivation (involvement, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Ability (knowledge, etc.)</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>High motivation and high ability tends to result in central route processing.</li>
                <li>When one of these is missing, we tend to use peripheral route processing.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Matching persuasive appeals to the situation using the Elaboration Likelihood model.
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Some products/services are not as well suited to messages that would rely on central route processing.
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Cosmetics/personal grooming products</li>
                        <li>Clothes, accessories (image-based products)</li>
                        <li>Hiring seasonal/temporary hourly workers</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>On the other hand, some products are not as well suited to messages that would rely on peripheral route processing.
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Real estate, computers, furniture (or hiring a decorator)</li>
                        <li>Hiring a CEO</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Argument strength
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Argument strength is in the eye of the audience.</li>
                        <li>What YOU think is a strong argument is completely irrelevant.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>You have to know your audience well in order to create &ldquo;strong&rdquo; arguments.
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Cognitive capacity
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Audience members&rsquo; cognitive capacity will affect how they process a message.</li>
                                <li>Cognitive capacity is a person&rsquo;s ability to think about arguments.</li>
                                <li>Need for Cognition (NFC) is a person&rsquo;s interest in engaging in effortful thinking.</li>
                                <li>Cognitive capacity is also affected by how much distraction is in the environment and how much stress a person is under.</li>
                                <li>And sometimes, we just feel cognitively lazy. &nbsp;Our brains get tired if we&rsquo;ve exerted a lot of effort recently.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Some Key Findings
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Attitudes formed via central processing are more persistent and durable than attitudes formed via peripheral processing.</li>
                <li>Increasing receivers&rsquo; perceived involvement in an issue can promote central processing.</li>
