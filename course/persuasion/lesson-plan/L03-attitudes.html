        <li>Review of previous session&rsquo;s content</li>
        <li>Lesson opening: What&rsquo;s in an &ldquo;attitude&rdquo;? We use the term &ldquo;attitude&rdquo; in our everyday talk. &nbsp;But what does it mean?
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>&ldquo;I like your attitude.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Attitude is everything.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;You have an attitude.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.&rdquo;</li>

        <li>Defining "Attitude", Essential features
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>A learned predisposition to respond favorably or unfavorably toward some attitude object.</li>
                <li>Attitudes are not innate.</li>
                <li>Attitudes are not static; they can change over time.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Attitudes have several components:
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Affective: positive/negative, favorable/unfavorable</li>
                <li>Behavioral: actions</li>
                <li>Cognitive: knowledge</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The functions that attitudes serve:
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Utilitarian:
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Helps us to maximize rewards and minimize punishments in our environment.</li>
                        <li>Helps you decide whether an attitude object will give you &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; or &ldquo;pain.&rdquo;</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Knowledge:
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Attitudes organize and structure our environment and provide consistency in our frame of reference.</li>
                        <li>Example: When we know someone&rsquo;s political attitudes (conservative vs. liberal), we feel like we know something about what they&rsquo;re like as a person.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Social Identity or Value:
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Helps us to foster identification with important reference groups and gain acceptance. &nbsp;This is a social identity function.</li>
                        <li>What can the attitude object help you say about yourself?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Self-Esteem Function of Attitudes (aka &ldquo;Ego Defense&rdquo;)
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Helps us to develop defense mechanisms for coping with psychological conflict. &nbsp;(Bad experiences in gym class; Dislike of sports.)</li>
                        <li>Keeps us from associating with &ldquo;stigmatized&rdquo; out-groups that might alienate us from our in-groups.</li>
                        <li>What self-doubts does the attitude object help you overcome?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Measuring attitudes
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Measuring them (well) is not easy!<br />
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Organ donation</li>
                        <li>Drug use</li>
                        <li>Sex education</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The most common types of measurement scales:
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Likert-type scales: 5 or 7 point scales that ask people&rsquo;s degree of agreement with a statement.</li>
                        <li>Semantic differentials: use bipolar terms and have individuals indicate where in &ldquo;semantic space&rdquo; their attitude falls.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Response Biases: The Limitations of Scales and Measurement
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Social desirability bias: People report what they think are the most socially acceptable attitudes, not necessarily what they really think.</li>
                        <li>Non-attitudes: People might not care about an issue but feel pressure to have an opinion.</li>
                        <li>Acquiescence bias: People are much more likely to agree with a statement than to disagree with it.</li>
                        <li>Mindfulness: Need to know your own mind to be able to report your attitude.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Which of these response biases affect attitudes to organ donation? to drug use? to sex ed?</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Attitude-Behavior Consistency
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Discussion: We care about knowing what people&rsquo;s attitudes are because they are assumed to drive human behavior.
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Are attitudes consistent with people&rsquo;s behaviors?</li>
                        <li>What are some examples of attitudes not being consistent with behavior?</li>
                        <li>What might explain this inconsistency?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Preview: Attitude&ndash;Behavior Link is Strongest When...
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>We don&rsquo;t confuse multiple attitudes with single attitudes.</li>
                        <li>There are repeated opportunities for behavior.</li>
                        <li>Attitudes are based on personal experience and direct observation (as opposed to &ldquo;hearsay&rdquo;).</li>
                        <li>Attitudes are central to a person&rsquo;s value system.</li>
                        <li>The possibility of social desirability is minimized.</li>
                        <li>An individual is a low self monitor.</li>
                        <li>The possibility of non-attitudes is minimized.</li>
                        <li>The accessibility of our attitudes is high.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>We don&rsquo;t confuse multiple attitudes with single attitudes.
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>A person&rsquo;s attitudes are often a collection of attitudes on multiple issues.</li>
                        <li>Exercise, technology, &ldquo;eating healthy&rdquo;</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>There are repeated opportunities for behavior.
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Consistency across time is more reliable indicator than a one-shot observation.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Attitudes are based on personal experience and direct observation (as opposed to &ldquo;hearsay&rdquo;).
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>&ldquo;Aunt Shirley says that Hondas are unreliable.&rdquo;</li>
                        <li>&ldquo;Your grandfather never exercised or ate vegetables and he lived to be 94.&rdquo;</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Attitudes are central to a person&rsquo;s value system
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Some attitudes are more important than others.</li>
                        <li>Example: staying healthy for your kids&rsquo; sake vs. &ldquo;vanity&rdquo; weight loss.</li>
                        <li>Example: vegetarians aren&rsquo;t as likely to eat bacon as someone who is just dieting.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The possibility of social desirability is minimized
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>When not on public display, we may act differently.</li>
                        <li>You might respond differently to a survey about your eating habits depending on who contacted you. &nbsp;(Health insurance company vs. market research firm.)</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>An individual is a low self monitor
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Less likely to adapt behavior to circumstances.</li>
                        <li>Low self-monitors are more likely to be happy to &ldquo;eat poorly&rdquo; in front of others than high self-monitors.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The possibility of non-attitudes is minimized
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>People don&rsquo;t like to look dumb, so they sometimes make up attitudes.</li>
                        <li>This is one reason why opinion polls are often unreliable.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The accessibility of our attitudes is high
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Whether our attitudes are &ldquo;at the top of our mind.&rdquo;</li>
                        <li>If a family member is diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, most people become more concerned with their dietary habits.</li>
                        <li>Similarly, a celebrity&rsquo;s cancer diagnosis can prompt other people to get screened for cancer.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Attitude accessibility creates greater bias in message processing AND motivates critical processing.
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Factors affecting attitude accessibility<br />
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Expectations
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>When you know you will have to evaluate an object in the future, you will think more about your attitudes.</li>
                                <li>Example: you know you will be buying a car so you start thinking about what&rsquo;s most important to you about a car (gas mileage, appearance, safety, reliability).</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Cognitive elaboration
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>The more work you do to evaluate an object, the more solid and accessible your attitude will be.</li>
                                <li>Example: If you show up to a car dealership without having done a lot of research or thinking, you&rsquo;ll probably leave the car lot feeling like you don&rsquo;t know what you want. (Or, you may feel regret having bought a car that wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;right.&rdquo;)</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Recency of activation
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>If not re-activated, new attitudes could fade quickly and be less accessible.</li>
                                <li>Example: By the time you need to buy another car, you will have to think about your attitudes all over again because so much time has passed.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Frequency of activation
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>The more often you think about something, the more accessible your attitude toward it will be.</li>
                                <li>Example: If you sell cars for a living (or if your friends are always buying new cars), you will know what your attitudes are even if you&rsquo;re not in the market for a car yourself.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Some final thoughts:
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>We look for information that supports our attitudes; counter-attitudinal information is counter-argued.</li>
                <li>Sometimes you can get people to more fully process a message that runs counter to their attitudes by asking them to try to hold &ldquo;correct&rdquo; attitudes.</li>
                <li>Attitudes don&rsquo;t work alone, they tend to be part of associative networks
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>We link attitudes toward one object with attitudes toward other objects</li>
                        <li>This is the basis for image-oriented advertising as well as the use of celebrity endorsements</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>We desire consistency between our attitudes and our behavior
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Our desire for cognitive consistency can help us understand why our attitudes do or do not change</li>
                        <li>Building a brand and capitalizing on loyalty to it (or rather, its image) is often effective in helping to sell products.</li>
                        <li>Cognitive inconsistency can generate enough guilt that it will drive behavior or behavior change.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
