        <li>Defining credibility
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Credibility is a person's "believability" and their ability to inspire trust.</li>
                <li>Facts about Credibility
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Although credibility is a characteristic of the source (or the speaker), it is conferred by the audience.
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>In other words, you can't say (with certainty) "I'm credible." Only your audience can say, "This person is credible."</li>
                                <li>Credibility changes depending on the audience and the situation.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Credibility is dynamic: you can gain or lose it.</li>
                        <li>Credibility is a heuristic or peripheral cue we use under conditions of low motivation or ability (ELM).&nbsp;If we are motivated and able, credibility is only one component we consider.</li>
                        <li>Credibility is Multidimensional
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Lots of characteristics can contribute to someone's credibility (or hurt it).</li>
                                <li>The most important characteristics are called the "primary dimension."
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Competence/Expertise (Experienced, informed, trained, skilled, intelligent, expert)</li>
                                        <li>Character/Trustworthiness (Honest, trustworthy, fair, just, unselfish)</li>
                                        <li>Goodwill (Cares about me, wants the best for me)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>There are other characteristics that are still somewhat important. These form the "secondary dimension" of credibility.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Composure (Poised, relaxed, calm, composed)</li>
                                        <li>Sociability (Good-natured, cheerful, friendly)</li>
                                        <li>Extroversion (Bold, verbal, aggressive, talkative)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

        <li>The Halo Effect (Thorndike, 1920)
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>The "halo effect" happens when credibility that we have in one area carries over and helps us be persuasive in an unrelated area.</li>
                <li>An actor from a daytime serial ("soap opera") appeared in a 1986 commercial for cough syrup. ("I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.")</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The Sleeper Effect (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951)
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>The Sleeper Effect refers to the phenomenon of attributing credibility to a very low credibility source as time passes.</li>
                <li>We tend to forget important credibility cues over time, particularly if we're not aware of them before we hear the information.</li>
                <li>Immediately after a persuasive communication event:
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>A high-credibility source will create more positive attitudes toward the issue.</li>
                        <li>A low-credibility source will produce less-favorable attitudes toward the issue than the audience originally had (discounting cues).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>High credibility messages lose impact over time.</li>
                <li>Over time, in low credibility messages, audiences disassociate the source of the message from the message itself and attitudes become more favorable.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>How to Build (or Enhance) Your Credibility
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Be prepared</li>
                <li>Cite evidence</li>
                <li>Explain expertise</li>
                <li>Build trust</li>
                <li>Adapt language</li>
                <li>Speak powerfully</li>
                <li>Increase involvement</li>
                <li>Have yourself endorsed by a source that the audience considers credible</li>
