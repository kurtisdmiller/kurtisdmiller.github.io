                        <li>Factors that affect obedience to authority
                            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                                <li><strong>Physical Proximity:</strong> When the learner was in the same room as the teacher, obedience level dropped from 65% to 40%.</li>
                                <li><strong>Personal Responsibility:</strong>
                                    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                        <li>When assured the experimenters were responsible, the "teacher" (research subject) continued.</li>
                                        <li>Later experiments had research subjects acting as observers and gave them responsibility for outcomes. Under these conditions, they stopped the experiment when the "learner" gave negative reactions to the shock.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Rebellion:</strong> When we see others rebel, we are less likely to go along with authority.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>What are the ethics of this kind of research?
                            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                                <li>Subjects had a hard time with the experiment. They were reduced to "twitching, stuttering wrecks."</li>
                                <li>Milgram debriefed them and included a friendly reconciliation meeting between teacher and learner.</li>
                                <li>Follow-up survey showed 85% were willing to be future research participants.</li>
                                <li>Participants were deceived and were led to believe that they injured another person, which may have caused damage to their sense of self.</li>
                                <li>This type of research can no longer be done in the U.S.</li>

                    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                        <li>Power can be internalized. Symbols and trappings can affect the person who uses them, not just the public or those who are targeted.</li>
                        <li>Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Sometimes obedience is automatic, but sometimes we obey because we fear punishment for not obeying.
                    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                        <li>Our early socialization teaches us to respect figures of authority: police, firefighters, teachers, physicians, etc. ("Click-Whirr")</li>
                        <li>Most of the time it is probably rational to follow leaders and authority figures, but authority is a peripheral cue.</li>
                        <li>When obeying authority isn't automatic, slower responses can be seen as problematic by authority figures:

                        </li>
                        <li>Try to critically evaluate the true expertise and legitimacy of an authority figure.</li>
                        <li>Question authority when social and organizational change is needed.</li>

                    <li>What social positions do you occupy that come with authority?</li>
                    <li>What are the cues that signify those positions?</li>
