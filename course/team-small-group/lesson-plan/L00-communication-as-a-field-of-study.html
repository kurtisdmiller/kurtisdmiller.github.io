        <li><strong>Main Point 1:</strong> Communication is unavoidable, and candidates with communication skills are highly desired. <br />

                <li>Watzlawick, Beavin, &amp; Jackson wrote one of the chapters in the second edition of Mortensen's 1967 book, <em>Communication theory</em>, and in that chapter on page 51 they wrote that "You cannot not communicate."</li>
                <li>When the Graduate Management Admission Council surveyed corporate recruiters in 2017 about the top skills they were looking for in new hires, four of the top five skills were communication skills.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Main Point 3:</strong> There are several communication classes that satisfy the verbal communication component of the general education program at Tusculum. <br />
