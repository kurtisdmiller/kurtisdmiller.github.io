<h1>
				Relating to Others in Groups and Teams
</h1>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Students bring a variety of misconceptions about power into communication classes. A more fine-grained understanding of power and its influences on people is helpful in a large number of real-world situations.</p>
<p>By the end of this lesson, the student will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the variety of forms of power and situations involving power, including the societal fantasy of equal power.</li>
    <li>Apply the 5 bases of power described by French and Raven.</li>
    <li>Identify examples of times in their real-world groups when they had more or less power.</li>
</ul>

        <li>Power in groups and teams works differently than we think<br />
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Power is never equal. <em>Americans especially have a bias toward stating that there is equal power in relationships, especially in informal relationships, but that is basically never the case.</em></li>
                <li>Power differences are not necessarily bad.</li>
                <li>Power is not monolithic: there are different forms.</li>
                <li>Power is not constant: <em>Often it helps to think about how power can flow and shift within a relationship depending on specific situations and contexts.</em></li>
            </ol>

        <li>Sources of power in human interaction. "Bases of Power" (French &amp; Raven, 1959)
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li><strong>Reward power</strong> comes from the ability to dispense or deny positive &amp; negative rewards to someone if they do what you want (or not reward them if they don't).</li>
                <li><strong>Coercive power</strong> comes from the ability to use force (physical, social, emotional, political, or economic) to make people do what you want.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate power</strong> comes from society's acceptance that people in certain social positions (being &ldquo;the boss&rdquo;) are supposed to be "in charge." <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>The use of the word "Legitimate" here indicates that the power relationship is a result of the generally accepted rules of the culture associated with the roles that the participants are viewed as occupying.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Expert power</strong> comes from the value the receiver places on the source's education (PhD, MD, etc.) or their (generally relevant) experiences with a subject.</li>
                <li><strong>Referent power</strong> comes from the receiver's liking or admiration for the source. Movie stars and celebrities have this power, but so do ordinary people who are very popular.</li>
                <li><strong>Informational power</strong> (added by Raven in 1965) comes as a result of possessing information that others need or want.<em></em></li>
