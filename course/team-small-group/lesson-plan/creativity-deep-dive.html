    <li>Defining Creativity
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Creativity is actually really difficult to define! Is it:
                <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                    <li>Lots of ideas quickly?</li>
                    <li>Ideas that are different from others?</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Creativity as an individual phenomenon
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li></li>
        </ol>

    <li>Creativity as a group phenomenon
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Processes
                <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                    <li><strong>Brainstorming</strong> (Osborn, 1957) is probably the most famous group process that is designed for improving creativity, but...
                    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>It doesn't actually work! Real groups typically come up with <em>HALF</em> the ideas of "nominal groups" <em>OR LESS!</em> (Diehl &amp; Stroebe, 1987)</li>
                        <li>Possible sources of this difference include:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Production blocking</strong>, when people are busy listening instead of thinking, or have an idea and need to wait to share it until another group member finishes talking.</li>
                                <li><strong>Evaluation apprehension</strong>, when people don't share ideas because they fear negative judgments of the other group members.</li>
                                <li><strong>Free riding</strong>, where people do less work as group size increases because their contributions 1) are less identifiable and 2) have decreased perceived effectiveness.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                    <li>Leaders have different roles for supporting creativity in groups depending in the different phases of innovation. (Hunter &amp; Cusherbery, 2011)
