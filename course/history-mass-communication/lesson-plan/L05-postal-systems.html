            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Presses
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>The flat-bed press. This is the form of press that Gutenberg used.
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Between 1400 and 1450, scholars estimate that European scribes produced a total of approximately 20,000 books across the continent. In the next 50 years, between 1450 and 1500, printers produced about <em>12 million</em> books.</li>
                                <li>Gutenberg produced 180 copies of the Gutenberg bible in 5 years, which is about the time it takes a scribe to create 1 copy.</li>
                                <li>Gutenberg sold Bibles for 30 florins (about 3-years wages for an average clerk at the time)</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>The rotary press. Dramatically sped up the creation of printed pages by making it possible run the press with a steam engine.
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Versions were invented in the 1790s, but Richard M. Hoe patented the first commercially successful version in 1847.</li>
                                <li>Hoe's four-cylinder rotary press could produce about 8,000 pages an hour.</li>
                                <li>In 1890, Thomas Nelson, Jr. patented an improved version (for the same company), which could print both sides of the page at the same time.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Typesetting
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Hand typesetting. This is the method that was used for most of the history of printing.
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Individual characters were formed into a lines, then lines were arranged in a page-sized frame and clamped tightly, using wooden spacers to fill gaps.</li>
                                <li>A skilled hand typesetter can produce about 250 ems per hour (the "em" is a measure of length in typography that is as long as a letter "m.")</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Linotype. Invented by Ottmar Mergenthaler in 1884.
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Linotype machines automated three key steps of typesetting.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>It assembled lines of text using character blanks using a keyboard</li>
                                        <li>It cast complete, single-use lines of text from the individual character blanks</li>
                                        <li>It automatically sorted the character blanks for re-use</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>This process reduced the number of character blanks needed, since the machine only needed to have enough blanks to typeset a single line, rather than an entire page.</li>
                                <li>Linotype machines stored all of the blanks in a single cartridge, which could be changed out. This allowed typesetters to change fonts and font sizes.</li>
                                <li>On later versions, operators could choose different font faces (Roman/Italic) without changing cartridges by selecting which portion of the blank to cast.</li>
                                <li>Linotype was in active use for major daily newspapers until the late 1970s and early 1980s. The New York Times published their last edition typeset using Linotype on July 2, 1978.</li>
                                <li>A skilled Linograph operator can produce about 4,000 to 6,000 ems per hour.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Photographic and digital typesetting. These produce text at the rate of thousands of lines per minute. At this point, writing speed, and not typesetting, was the limiting factor.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Postal systems.
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Development of Postal Systems&nbsp;
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Ad hoc systems for sending and delivering mail date back to the invention of writing. Many of the oldest cuneiform tablets were used for this. One of the most famous, the Letter of Complaint Tablet Ea-nasir, dates to circa 1750 B.C.E., and complains about poor-quality copper. (I encourage you to read a translation. You can still feel the author's anger, nearly 4,000 years later: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinakillgrove/2018/05/11/meet-the-worst-businessman-of-the-18th-century/?sh=59569bc2d5de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinakillgrove/2018/05/11/meet-the-worst-businessman-of-the-18th-century/?sh=59569bc2d5de</a>)</li>
                        <li>Governments of large areas realized the importance of having some sort of courier system to carry messages between regional officials and the seat of power.</li>
                        <li>The first true postal <em>system</em> appears in Persia, and was likely organized by King Cyrus the Great, although some scholars argue it may have been his successor, King Darius the First.
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Mandated every province arrange for delivery of mail to its citizens.</li>
                                <li>Arranged for neighboring countries to also provide this service</li>
                                <li>Built roads to support this courier network (and also the movement of troops)</li>
                                <li>Built postal stations throughout the empire, and spaced them according to careful study of how far a mounted courier could ride at a hard gallop.</li>
                                <li>The purpose of this postal system was as much for gathering intelligence as for sending mail</li>
                                <li>The book of Esther in the Bible mentions this mail system.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Augustus established the Roman courier and mail service, the Cursus Publicus, circa "year 0"</li>
                        <li>The stamp was invented in 1840. Before this, most postage in most postal systems was paid by the recipient, not by the sender. Afterward, the concept of a single rate for domestic mail, regardless of the distance, began to proliferate.</li>
                        <li>The Pony Express. This service delivered express mail between the East and West coast of the US in 10 days (and got word to California newspapers of Lincoln's election in under 8 days. Although it was pretty famous, it only ran for 18 months, from April 3, 1860, to October 26, 1861, before telegraph lines bankrupted the service. It's direct impact on mass communication was minimal, but its impact on US popular culture has proven to be long lasting.</li>
                        <li>Postal services used to deliver mail as often as the post office received shipments. In the US, that was generally twice daily, although in business districts of major cities it could be three deliveries per day. Residential service dropped to one delivery per day in the 1950s, and businesses generally had two deliveries a day into the 1970s.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Impact of Postal Systems
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>The combination of mail systems, printing, and cheap paper effectively turned the Post into an effective system of mass communication</li>
                        <li>Creation of the magazine industry</li>
                        <li>Some newspapers, especially regional and national papers, used mail delivery rather than their own delivery systems.</li>
                        <li>Direct mail advertising</li>
                        <li>Mail order catalogs! They introduced the idea of making purchases anonymously, individually, and privately, and provided remote areas with access to huge inventories of goods. Two of these are especially important in US History:
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Sears. Started as a catalog business.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>J.C. Penney. Started as a retail department store that later expanded into catalog sales. The first large-scale use of the "ship to store" model which eliminated last-mile delivery costs.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Fun mail facts! Historically, there were very few rules about what could be sent in the mail.
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>It was legal to mail people until 1920, as long as they were less than the weight limit, and there are several documented cases of children being mailed to visit relatives, because it was cheaper than purchasing train tickets</li>
                        <li>The Hope Diamond was delivered to The Smithsonian in 1958 in a regular box. It was valued at over $1 million at the time.</li>
                        <li>Today, mail deliveries can live animals (including chicks and bees!)</li>
                    </ol>
