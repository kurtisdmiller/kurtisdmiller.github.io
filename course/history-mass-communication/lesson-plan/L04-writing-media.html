<h1>
				Writing Media
</h1>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Writing media had profound effects on the speed of production and ease of transmission of ideas. The development of improved media dramatically changed writing itself, mass communication, and society as a whole.</p>
<p>By the end of this lesson, the student will be able to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>List the major categories of writing media</li>
    <li>Provide examples of writing media in each category</li>
    <li>Discuss the relationship between writing media and writing systems</li>
</ol>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Body</strong></p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
        <li>Simple media. These record meaning using a single material. Some carved media are also supplemented with paint, though the paint is typically not necessary for writing.
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Stone. Usually carved with a hammer and chisel. Writing systems primarily recorded in stone tend to be composed of straight lines, often prioritizing a specific line length which is the same as the width of the chisel. Use in large inscriptions encourages use of boustrophedon writing.</li>
                <li>Wood. Usually carved. Writing implements include hammer and chisel, blades, and sharpened awls. The presence of wood grain makes carving along the grain prone to problems, so writing systems primarily recorded on wood typically will avoid right angles to keep lines from going along the grain.</li>
                <li>Bone/shell/horn/tusk. Usually carved. Writing implements include hammer and chisel, blades, sharpened awls, and drills. Writing systems used here tend to favor straight lines.</li>
                <li>Clay. Either in the form of tablets which are marked with impressions while wet using a stylus of some kind (ex. cuneiform). Alternately, pressed into forms and fired. Ability to accidentally erase writing generally promotes writing systems that move from top-to-bottom and/or left-to-right.</li>
                <li>Wax. Generally used for important, but temporary records, often placed into a folding tablet (see visual aid). Examples date back to circa 1300 B.C.E. Generally did not influence writing systems directly as this was usually a supplementary writing medium rather than a primary one.</li>
                <li>Leather. Generally marked with impressions using a variety of different leatherworking tools. Generally did not influence writing systems directly as this was usually a supplementary writing medium rather than a primary one.</li>
                <li>Fabrics. Generally woven using different materials or materials dyed different colors. Generally not a primary writing medium.</li>
                <li>Paper (cardstock). Usually not a simple medium, but braille is a notable exception. Braille is produced either using a braille typewriter or using a slate and stylus. When using a slate and stylus, it must be written backwards (from right-to-left) because it is written and read from opposite sides of the same sheet of paper.</li>
                <li>Quipu. Uses knotted chords to convey information
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Generally numerical in a positional base-10 numbering system, though some appear to be number labels (such as a Zip code). Research indicates that both the specific material used and the color the strand was dyed likely carried meaning in some contexts. (Note: These are technically a semi-composite media, because they are usually created with strings made of multiple materials.)</li>
                        <li>The system generally used three types of knots, including a distinctive "long knot" in the ones position, so that multiple numbers could be encoded on a single string of the Quipu. (40 would include 4 regular knots in the tens position, 43 would add a knot in the ones position with three turns, 41 would use a figure-8 knot in the ones position).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Composite media. These record meaning by combining two different materials
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Hard surfaces (stone, wood, clay pottery, etc.). Typically are painted with a brush of some kind, though there are exceptions (slate chalkboards are one example). Bamboo (China) and Birch bark (India) are notably important.</li>
                <li>Leaves. Palm-leaf manuscripts were especially common in India. These tend to be fairly fragile, and promote writing systems that avoid using hard corners. Usually they were written with a knife, then ink or dye was applied to the entire surface and wiped away, leaving it in the tool marks.</li>
                <li>Paper and paper-like media
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Papyrus. Manufactured from the pith of the papyrus plant. It cannot be folded, meaning it needs to be used in scrolls, and it is vulnerable to both low and high humidity. It is cheap and easy to produce. The earliest papyrus documents found date back to circa 2500 B.C.E. and describe the final stages of building the Great Pyramid of Giza of during the reign of Khufu.</li>
                        <li>Parchment/Vellum. Specially prepared animal skins. Similar in age to Papyrus. Relatively expensive and labor-intensive to manufacture. More durable and less vulnerable to humidity changes. From an archaeology perspective, parchment is especially interesting because animal skins often have enough DNA that markers and sequences can be identified, meaning that ancient parchment documents can be traced to specific regional animal populations, sometimes to common herds/suppliers, and in rare cases can be traced to the same animal.</li>
                        <li>Amate. Produces in much the same way as modern paper, but from tree bark. It was manufactured in Mesoamerican cultures, with the oldest examples dating back to 75 C.E.</li>
                        <li>Paper.&nbsp;
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Rag paper. Generally made of hemp, linen, flax, cotton or other industrial plant fibers. The earliest known paper in existence was used in China circa 179-141 B.C.E.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The predominate form of paper for most of its existence</li>
                                        <li>Often manufactured from old and worn-out clothing, ropes, fishing nets, etc.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Pulp paper
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Using wood-pulp to create paper didn't occur until that process was finally commercialized successfully in 1843. This led to an explosion in the availability of cheap paper, and enabled the commercial success of media formats which were not intended for long-term consumption, like the newspaper.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                <li>Writing tools
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Brushes. Allows for easily creating rounded shapes.</li>
                        <li>Pens. Allows for easily creating rounded shapes. Wet ink promotes use of left-to-right and/or top-to-bottom writing.
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Reed pens. These were the first type of pen developed, with the earliest examples dating back to circa 300 B.C.E. They needed to be dipped in ink regularly.</li>
                                <li>Quill pens. Commonly used starting circa 500 C.E. Also needed to be dipped in ink regularly, but the softer tip wore out less quickly than reed pens.</li>
                                <li>Dip pens. The earliest example dates back to circa 100 C.E., but they didn't become commonly available until the industrial revolution in the 1800s. Also needed to be dipped in ink regularly, but the metal tips were dramatically more durable than quill pens. They remained in common use, especially in education, through the 1950s and early 1960s because they were much cheaper than fountain pens.</li>
                                <li>Fountain pens. These included their own ink reservoir, so that writing didn't have to be stopped every few letters to refill them. They first appear in reasonable quantities in the middle 1800s, but remain quite expensive throughout their lifespan.</li>
                                <li>Ballpoint pens. First patented in 1888 by John L. Loud. A series of innovations gradually made them more reliable, and they really started becoming popular after World War 2. They became the dominant form of handwriting implement in the 1960s. Fun fact: the most popular pen is the Bic Cristal. The 100 billionth of these was sold in 2006, and worldwide sales currently total about 57 pens <em>per second</em>.</li>
                                <li>Markers and Felt-tip pens. These are a relative newcomer, with the first patent being issued in 1910 to Lee Newman. "Magic markers" came later, in 1953.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Honorable mentions: Pencils, Erasers, and Crayons were all also important developments in the history of writing media, and they had some really profound impacts on a variety of fields, especially education. However, they had negligible impacts on mass communication.</li>

                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Portable Formats
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Tablets</li>
                <li>Scrolls</li>
                <li>Codexes (books)
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>First appear circa 100 C.E.</li>
                        <li><em>Rapidly</em> replace scrolls in common use due to having a large number of advantages. Scrolls essentially non-existent by 600 C.E.</li>
                        <li>Advantages include:
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Sturdy</li>
                                <li>Can be held and read in one hand</li>
                                <li>Generally uses <em>both sides</em> of the paper for writing</li>
                                <li>Allows one to easily access any portion of the written work, rather than sequential access only</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Early Printing. Note, there is a lot of history of printing that has to do with textile manufacture and decoration, rather than mass communication. This discussion glosses over most of those parts of the history of printing.
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>Stenciling. The earliest known stencils are those Neanderthal hand prints we discussed in the lesson on Mass Communication before Writing. Stencils remain in common use for brief messages that need to be quickly reproduced on diverse materials.</li>
                <li>Seals. The predecessor of printing was the seal, which predates written language. The oldest known seal dates to circa 5000 B.C.E. They were pressed into clay, wax, and other impressionable media to leave a permanent identifiable mark.</li>
                <li>Stamps (especially Woodblock prints)
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>China and the East. The earliest records of printing go back to circa 220 C.E. in China to decorate fabrics. Bhuddist texts were being printed in relatively large numbers by 670 C.E., but were generally produced for ceremonial purposes rather than reading (ex. to bury at consecrated sites). The earliest printed text intended to be read appears soon after, by 700 C.E. and is a partial copy of Lotus Sutra, but this date is based on changes in character forms common during that time. The Diamond Sutra was published later, and is actually dated, saying "Reverently made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong" (May 11th, 868 C.E.)</li>
                        <li>Europe and the West. The earliest records of printing go back to circa 100 C.E. in Egypt to decorate fabrics. Block printing transitioned to paper circa 1400 C.E. in Europe when paper became widely available. Block printing remained popular for single-sheet products and illustration-heavy documents, such as playing cards and religious icons long after the introduction of movable type. Block printed books remained popular long after the introduction of movable type because they could include illustrations. They tended to be much briefer than books produced with movable type.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Movable type.
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>China and the East. This first appears in China in 1041 C.E., and was produced by Bi Sheng. Movable type was widely used, but for generally limited purposes (such as producing bank notes, where portions of a document needed to be changed regularly from a relatively limited subset of symbols). Most scholars believe that this was caused by the rather large set of symbols necessary to produce text in languages that employ writing systems with a large number of fundamental symbols (such as Chinese). Woodblock prints remained the most common method of printing in China until the late 1800s.</li>
                        <li>Europe and the West. Movable type arrived in Europe sometime in the early 1400s, with Gutenberg receiving the majority of the recognition for it (though, unlike his press, it is unclear how much of it was his own innovation.)</li>
