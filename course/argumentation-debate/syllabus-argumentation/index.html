As part of this class, students will prepare for and compete in debate events as part of the Debate team.
Emphasis will be given to discussion of current issues.
Travel to at least two competitive events will be required, as well as a fee to offset competition entrance fees, transportation costs, and other expenses.
Students may not take COMM 120 Debate Team Practicum and this course for credit in the same semester.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The syllabus for this course is subject to change at any time.</em>
<em>This includes, but is not limited to, such elements as required assignments, grading requirements/scales and the course calendar.</em>
<em>Updates will be communicated through the Moodle announcement system.</em></p>

<h2 id="general-education-student-learning-outcomes">General Education Student Learning Outcomes</h2>

<h2 id="required-texts-and-materials">Required Texts and Materials</h2>

<p>There is no required textbook for this class.
Readings may be assigned and distributed through Moodle.
You will need paper and a writing utensil, a device for conducting research (phone, laptop, etc.), and a standard kitchen timer in every class meeting.</p>

<h2 id="attendance-and-participation">Attendance and Participation</h2>

<p>Attendance will be taken regularly.
Attendance records will be kept and reported to the extent required by law and university policy.
Participating regularly in class is assessed as a portion of your <a href="/course/argumentation-debate/assignment/professionalism-grade/" title="Assignment description">Professionalism</a> grade.
Attendance is strongly encouraged, as the majority of the points in this class come from in-class activities.
<!--TODO: create Professionalism Assignment page --></p>

<h2 id="late-work-policy">Late Work Policy</h2>

<p>Late work may be turned in up to 1 calendar day after the deadline.
Late work will lose 10% of the available points.
Late or missing work will also result in penalties to your <a href="/course/argumentation-debate/assignment/professionalism-grade/" title="Assignment description">Professionalism</a> grade.
Using technology is a basic expectation of students at this level of study &ndash; issues with technology are not an excuse for late or missing work.
If you need assistance with technology, contact <a href="http://www3.tusculum.edu/is/" target="_blank">Information Services</a>.</p>

<h3 id="alternate-deadlines">Alternate Deadlines</h3>

<p>In some rare cases an emergency may require you to miss class and turn in work after the assigned due date.
These situations are handled on a case-by-case basis and, depending on the situation and documentation, this work may be assigned an alternate deadline.
Coursework assigned an alternate deadline is graded for full credit, but will not receive feedback.</p>

<p>Alternate deadlines will not be assigned for absences that can be planned for &ndash; this includes school-sponsored events, such as athletics.</p>

<h2 id="classroom-behavior">Classroom Behavior</h2>

<p>We are a community of learners, and your classmates are entitled to the standard professional courtesies.
Show respect for every person in the classroom.
Complete your assigned work on time.
Be ready for classroom discussion and activities.
Ask questions.
Be supportive audience members.
Any member of an activity group should be prepared to present the work of the entire group.
Each student is required to conduct themselves in an appropriate manner at all times.
Racist, sexist, or other offensive or discriminatory language will not be tolerated.
Keep all devices (phones, tablets, laptops, headphones, etc.) out of sight, unless their use is required for a classroom activity.
Unprofessional behavior in the classroom will result in penalties to your <a href="/course/argumentation-debate/assignment/professionalism-grade/" title="Assignment description">Professionalism</a> grade.</p>

<h1 id="assignments-and-grading">Assignments and Grading</h1>

<p>Your final grade will be determined by the total points received out of 1000 points possible.
Your points will accumulate through the semester.
The largest portions of your final grade comes from <strong>Content Knowledge</strong>.
A second significant portion of your final grade comes from <strong>Practicing Debate</strong>.
You will also earn points from <strong>Professionalism</strong>.
<strong>Extra credit</strong> is available for this class.
<strong>You must participate in two debate competition in order to pass this class.</strong></p>

<h2 id="grading-scale">Grading Scale</h2>

<p>The grading scale for the class is below.
When determining final grades I will round up decimals to the next full point.
I will not round up multiple points.
There are many extra credit opportunities; see above for more information.</p>

Brief emails asking questions which are already answered in course documents (syllabus, calendar, assignment descriptions, etc.) may not receive a reply.</p>

<p>Engaging in professional communication with your professors and the university staff is important.
Some students benefit from the below email template, which comes from a post I wrote to help students with <a href="/post/writing-professional-emails/">writing professional emails</a>.
Whether you are in my class or any other class at the university, this template should work well. Just replace the information in brackets as needed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Subject: [class number and section]: [your issue]</p>

<p>Dear [Title Last Name  – if you can&rsquo;t find out, use &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; to be safe],</p>

<p>I am in your [time] [class name] class on [days class meets].
I have checked the [syllabus/assignment instructions/rubric/textbook/class resources] for an answer, but it does not adequately answer my question.
I need some additional help with [your issue].</p>

<p>[Second paragraph explaining your question.
Describe where you looked for answers, what you found, and how that information is not enough for you to have a clear answer to your question.
You may also include other relevant aspects of your situation.]</p>

<p>[OPTIONAL third paragraph where you propose answers or next steps.]</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>[Your First and Last Name]</p>
</blockquote>

I will not discuss your grades publicly.
Come to this meeting prepared to provide evidence supporting the need for a grade change.
Grades are considered final one week after they are posted in Moodle.</p>
